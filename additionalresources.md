## Step 1: Hook Up your Raspberry Pi
Connecting all your devices to the Raspberry Pi is very easy, but you want to do it in a specific order so it can recognize all your devices when it boots up. First, make sure the MicroSD card is properly inserted in your Pi.

Connect your HDMI cable to your Raspberry Pi and your monitor or your television, then connect your USB keyboard and mice.

Finally, once everything is connected, go ahead and plug in your power adapter. The Raspberry Pi does not have a power switch, so once you connect the power adapter, itâ€™ll turn on all by itself.
