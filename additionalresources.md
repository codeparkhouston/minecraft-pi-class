To use your Raspbrry Pi as a computer, you'll need to connect it to a keyboard, mice, and a monitor or TV. You need to connect them in a specific order so your Raspberry Pi can safely start.

First, make sure the MicroSD card is properly inserted in your Pi. Connect your HDMI cable to your Raspberry Pi and your monitor or your television, then connect your USB keyboard and mice.

Finally, once everything is connected, go ahead and plug in your power adapter. The Raspberry Pi does not have a power switch, so once you connect the power adapter, itâ€™ll turn on all by itself.
